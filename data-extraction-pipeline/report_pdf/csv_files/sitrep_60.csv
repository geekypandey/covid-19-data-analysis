STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
HO’s strategic objectives for this response are to: 
 
• 
Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts 
and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further 
international spread*;  
• 
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; 
• 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 
• 
Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment 
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 
• 
Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
• 
Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 
This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and 
risk communication."
