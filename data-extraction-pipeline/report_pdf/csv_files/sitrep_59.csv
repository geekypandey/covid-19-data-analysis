Objectives",
1,"The First Few COVID-19 
cases and contacts 
transmission investigation 
protocol (FFX)","To provide descriptions and/or estimates of the: 
• 
clinical presentation of COVID-19 infection and course of associated disease 
• 
secondary infection rate (SIR) and secondary clinical attack rate of COVID-19 
infection among close contacts (overall, and by key factors such as setting, age 
and sex, for various end-points) 
• 
serial interval of COVID-19 infection 
• 
symptomatic proportion of COVID-19 cases (through contact tracing and 
laboratory testing); and identification of possible routes of transmission"
2,"Households transmission 
of COVID-19 investigation 
protocol","• 
To better understand the extent of transmission within a household by estimating 
the secondary infection rate for household contacts at an individual level, and 
factors associated with any variation in the secondary infection risk 
• 
To characterize secondary cases including the range of clinical presentation, risk 
factors for infection, and the extent and fraction of asymptomatic infections 
• 
To characterize serologic response following confirmed COVID-19 infection"
3,"Assessment of COVID-19 
risk factors among Health 
workers protocol","• 
To better understand the extent of human-to-human transmission among health 
care workers, by estimating the secondary infection rate for health care worker 
contacts at an individual level 
• 
To characterize the range of clinical presentation of infection and the risk factors 
for infection among health care workers 
• 
To evaluate effectiveness of infection prevention and control measures among 
health care workers"
4,"Surface sampling of 
COVID-19 for health care 
professionals","• 
To assess the extent and persistence of surface contamination with COVID-19 
virus 
• 
To identify environmental surfaces which may play a role in onwards transmission 
of COVID-19 infection"
5,"Population based 
serologic survey","• 
To estimate age-specific seroprevalence"

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
HO’s strategic objectives for this response are to: 
 
• 
Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts 
and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further 
international spread*;  
• 
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; 
• 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 
• 
Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment 
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 
• 
Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
• 
Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 
This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and 
risk communication."
